# Email SDK example

Send one server-side email through Email SDK with `@samva/email-sdk`.

The example uses published dependency ranges for Email SDK and Samva, plus the
workspace adapter while developing this repository. Build and typecheck never
send or require credentials.

## Setup

```sh
bun install
cp examples/email-sdk/.env.example examples/email-sdk/.env
```

Replace the placeholder values in `.env`:

- `SAMVA_API_KEY` — a server-side key for the Samva account.
- `SAMVA_FROM` — a configured sender, as a bare or display-form address.
- `SAMVA_TO` — the recipient used for an explicit example send.

## Validate without sending

```sh
bun --filter @samva-examples/email-sdk typecheck
bun --filter @samva-examples/email-sdk build
```

## Send explicitly

This command calls the configured Samva account. It is not part of build,
typecheck, or repository tests.

```sh
bun --filter @samva-examples/email-sdk send
```

Missing environment variables throw before the adapter calls Samva.

See the [Email SDK cookbook](../../cookbooks/email-sdk.md) for the supported
field and failure contract.
